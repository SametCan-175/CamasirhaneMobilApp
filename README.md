📌 Abstract

In higher education dormitories, queue management in shared laundry rooms is generally handled using manual methods such as notebooks or verbal communication. This situation leads to time loss, confusion, and disputes among users.

In this project, a mobile based digital queue and machine monitoring system developed for dormitory laundries is presented. Users can log in using their name, surname, and phone number and access real time information such as machine availability, operating duration, and estimated remaining time.

The application was developed using React and React Native technologies. 91.8 percent of the software was written in TypeScript and 8.2 percent in JavaScript. Firebase was used for real time data management and storage.

As a result, the system eliminates manual queue tracking and provides a more organized, efficient, and user friendly laundry experience.
